  <h2>About us...</h2
    <p>Are you tired of studying in the same place every day? Need a change of scenery, but don't know where to go? In St. Andrews especially, it is easy to keep going back to the same places because we feel like there couldn't possibly be any study spaces we don't know in this small town, right? That's why we made St.udy. Our aim is to make different study spaces known to everyone in this town, from students to visitors. No matter what you are looking for - quiet study, group rooms, printers, good coffee, or the newest food trends while you slave away - we've got you covered.
